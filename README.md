A few of the Data Science projects I've been working on (Click on title to see full project).

# [Project 1: Predicting Soccer Players' Transfer Value](https://github.com/TundeRockson/My-Portfolio/blob/main/Soccer%20Proj/Soccer%20Project.ipynb)
This project focuses on predicting soccer players' transfer values to determine which players are overvalued, undervalued, or appropriately valued. To do this, data was scraped, cleaned, and analyzed from a soccer video game's dataset to create a table suitable for building multiple regression models to find the best predictor for what a player's value should be.

#### Language(s): Python

# [Project 2: Analyzing the Top 50 Solar Flares](https://github.com/TundeRockson/My-Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Top%2050%20Solar%20Flares/Top%2050%20Solar%20Flares.ipynb)
This is a project that involves web scraping information from the NASA and SpaceWeather websites about the top 50 solar flares ever observed, and combining data from the two sources sources in order to integrate and investigated both datasets to accurately replicate information about these happenings.

# [Project 3: Moneyball](https://github.com/TundeRockson/My-Portfolio/blob/main/Moneyball/Moneyball%20Project.ipynb)
This project utilizes methods such as data wrangling and exploratory data analysis to explore how efficient baseball teams, especially the Oakland A's, have been historically at spending money and getting wins in return.

# [Project 4: Statistical Analysis of a Survey with SAS](https://github.com/TundeRockson/My-Portfolio/blob/main/SAS%20Survey%20Project.pdf)
In this project, I'll explore whether a person's preferred sport is influenced by aspects like race, shoe size, height, and gender. I'll also look into whether a person's height and shoe size are related.
